If the institution makes such a material change (in the institution's reasonable opinion) which you reasonably believe will prejudicially affect you, you may either cancel the Contract and withdraw from the programme without any liability to the institution for tuition fees or transfer to such other programme (if any) as may be offered by the institution for which you are qualified. This clause 8.3 of the terms and conditions shall not apply to Tier 4 sponsored students or students who require a visa or other immigration permission to be able to carry out their studies.</p><p><strong>8.4 Withdrawal of a programme after registration</strong></p><p>If after you have registered as a student of the institution, the institution is forced to discontinue your programme as a result of a Force Majeure Event (as defined in Clause 12.3), the institution will notify you as soon as possible and use reasonable endeavours to transfer you to a suitable replacement programme for which you are qualified.
