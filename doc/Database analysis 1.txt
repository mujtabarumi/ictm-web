I am yet to formalise the database specification, however you can start designing the schema with following top level entities, 

Courses: this entity will cover the course related information
Pages: this entity will cover the html pages
News;this will store all the news
Events: this will store events
Notices: this is for notices
Faculties: this is for lecturer biography
Feedbacks: this is to store and display users feedback message
Photos: this one for all the photos info fro gallery
please note this TOP level entities only, we will need to find relevant lookup entitoes for each entity e,g. course will have "Department", pages will have "Menu" etc,
